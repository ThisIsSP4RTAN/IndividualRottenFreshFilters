<description>Adds fresh and rotten filters to the individual corpse categories

Let's say you just survived back-to-back raids from entities and raiders, some of the corpses have started to rot and you want to start cleaning up. 

Normally you'd have to create two separate stockpiles, one for fresh and one for rotten corpses. With this however, you can put fresh and rotten entity corpses together with rotten humanlike corpses in one stockpile and put the fresh humanlike corpses in your nearest butcher... burning stockpile!
